_Abstract_:
Simulating spin systems on classical computers is challenging for large systems due to the significant memory requirements. This makes Hamiltonian simulation by quantum computers a promising option due to the direct representation of quantum states in terms of its qubits. Standard algorithms for time evolution on quantum computers require circuits whose depth grows with time. We present a new algorithm, based on Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra generated by the Hamiltonian, that generates a circuit with time complexity O(1) for ordered and disordered models of n spins. We highlight our algorithm for special classes of models where an O(n^2)-gate circuit emerges. Compared to product formulas with significantly larger gate counts, our algorithm drastically improves simulation precision. Our algebraic technique sheds light on quantum algorithms and will reduce gate requirements for near term simulation.

# Documentation:
Please see the [Documentation](docs/) for Information on the Functions included in the package. Documetation generated by pdoc in the google style. A google style reference document is included. 

There are some issues with conflicts when generating the documentation. Here's the workaround and my steps:
<ol>  
  <li> Uninstall the package by deleting it from the site-packages folder </li>
  <li> Move setup.py out of the CQS folder </li>
  <li> Delete `\build`, `CQS.egg-info`, and `dist`.</li>
  <li> Comment out `__all__` from CQS.__init__.py</li>
  <li> Rename all the local import statements by adding `CQS.` in front of the statements in methods, examples, and util</li>
  <li> From the main folder (containing docs) run `pdoc -d google -o .\docs .\CQS</li>
  <li> Undo the previous steps: Move back setup.py, change the import statements back, uncomment `__all__`, and reinstall the package </li>
</ol>
I am sure there is a better way to do this, so I am open to suggestions.  This requires `pdoc` which can be installed as `pip install pdoc`


To recompile the documentation, run 
`pdoc -d google -o .\docs .\package` 
from the root folder (requires pdoc)
